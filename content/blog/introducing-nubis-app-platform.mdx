## The Problem We're Solving

Every African startup building software faces the same friction: deploying to production is unnecessarily painful. You spin up a VM somewhere in Europe or the US, SSH in, configure Nginx, set up SSL certificates, build a CI pipeline, and pray the deployment doesn't break at 2 AM.

Meanwhile, your users in Lagos, Nairobi, or Accra are experiencing 200-400ms of added latency on every single request because the nearest server is 5,000 kilometers away.

We built the Nubis App Platform to eliminate this entire problem.

## What is Nubis App Platform?

Nubis App Platform is a fully managed Platform-as-a-Service that automatically builds and deploys your web applications directly from GitHub. You connect your repository, we handle everything else:

- **Automatic builds** from your GitHub repository
- **Zero-config SSL** certificates provisioned and renewed automatically
- **Global CDN** with edge nodes across Africa
- **Atomic deploys** with instant rollback capability
- **Auto-scaling** that responds to traffic spikes in real-time

There's no Dockerfile to write. No Kubernetes manifests to maintain. No YAML files to debug at midnight.

## How It Works

The deployment workflow is deliberately simple:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Nubis App Platform
2. Select your branch and framework (we auto-detect Next.js, React, Vue, Python, Go, and more)
3. Push your code
4. Your app is live on a `.usenubis.com` subdomain with SSL in under 90 seconds

Every subsequent push to your configured branch triggers an automatic build and deploy. Failed builds don't affect your running application — we only promote successful deployments.

## Built for African Developers

This isn't a generic PaaS that happens to serve Africa. We've made specific engineering decisions to optimize for developers on the continent:

- **Lagos edge deployment** — sub-30ms latency for West African users
- **Local currency billing** — pay in NGN, KES, or EUR without conversion fees or surprise exchange rate fluctuations
- **Optimized for African network conditions** — our build servers and CDN are tuned for the bandwidth and routing characteristics of African ISPs
- **Paystack integration** — pay with the payment methods you already use

## Pricing

App Platform follows the same transparent pricing model as the rest of Nubis infrastructure. The base tier starts at $5/month per app and includes:

- 512MB RAM
- Shared CPU
- 100GB bandwidth
- Automatic SSL
- Custom domains

Scaling from there is linear and predictable — no surprise bills from traffic spikes.

## What's Next

App Platform is currently in beta with early access for registered users. We're actively building out additional features including:

- **Preview deployments** for pull requests
- **Environment management** (staging, production) per branch
- **Integrated monitoring** with our existing metrics infrastructure
- **Database auto-provisioning** — spin up a managed PostgreSQL or Redis alongside your app with one click

## Get Started

If you're building a web application that serves African users, the App Platform is the fastest path from code to production. No infrastructure expertise required.
